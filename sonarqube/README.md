## How to use this image
Here you'll find the Docker images for the Community Edition, Developer Edition, Enterprise Edition, and Data Center Edition of SonarQube.

## Docker Host Requirements
Because SonarQube uses an embedded Elasticsearch, make sure that your Docker host configuration complies with the [Elasticsearch production mode requirements](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode) and [File Descriptors configuration](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/file-descriptors.html).

For example, on Linux, you can set the recommended values for the current session by running the following commands as root on the host:

```bash
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=524288
sysctl -w fs.file-max=131072
ulimit -n 131072
ulimit -u 8192
```
